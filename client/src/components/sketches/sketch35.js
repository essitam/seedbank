//An object at rest and an object in motion stays in motion 
//at a constant spped and direction UNLESS acted pone by an UNBALANCED force. 
// >>do al the net forces on an object add up to a non-zero.
// a force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate. 

//3rd law : Force always occurs in pairs. The two forces are of equal strength, but in opposite directions

// The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object (measured in kilograms).
// Weight, though often mistaken for mass, is technically the force of gravity on an object. From Newtonâ€™s second law, we can calculate it as mass times the acceleration of gravity (w = m * g). Weight is measured in newtons.
// Density is defined as the amount of mass per unit of volume (grams per cubic centimeter, for example).


//a Force is a vector that causes and object with mass, to accelerate

// force = mass * acceleration  // voide update
//standard
///////acc = force!
//vel.add(acc)
//loc.add(vel)

// Force = Mass * Acceleration
// A = F/M
//A = F 

//if Mass = 1
//A = F!


// in coding land we are assuming a mass = 1 so Force = Mass * acceleration meaning 1 * acceleration meaning Force = acceleration
///--->>key A = F/M  force divided by mass. if i calculate that i can build of previous code that has
// vel.add(acc)
//pos.add(vel) /// velocity is the change in position over time.
