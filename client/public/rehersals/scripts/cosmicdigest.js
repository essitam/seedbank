const emailThread = ['Chapter 1 Radical Empiricism Plane and Material: Pure Experience Plane and Material: Pure Experience One of the essential features of empiricism in general involves the construction of a plane that allows for observing how exceeding our limits, beliefs, judgments, and so forth are made. Experience is observed on the basis of a sort of pure experience, a ﬁrst moment of inexperience — the blank slate. For classical empiricists like Locke and Hume, this plane remains inextricable from human ignorance or newborn’s lack of knowledge, when the mind is still but a disparate set of psychic atoms without connections among them. Thus Hume asks whether someone who has never seen water can infer from its ﬂuidity and transparency that it will suffocate him. Rather than interpreting this artiﬁce in terms of a battle between Innatism and Cartesianism, we should think of this gesture in terms of the establishment of a new method. Of course the Cartesian method of doubt also lies in producing a tabula rasa of all forms of knowledge; the force of doubt, however, appears like the negative ﬂipside of the basic certainty that has not yet been discovered but is already is concealed, the “I think.” Put another way, Cartesianism does not truly entail a blank slate since it allows the “I think” an existence outside of it, which “I think” devises the blank slate and determines its ﬁnality. The advantage of the empiricist method is that it does not allow for anything outside. It begins with a plane where nothing is preestablished, where no form of knowledge, no certainty — even virtual — has yet appeared, such that everything has the right to be constructed. In James’s psychology, everything begins in the manner of classical empiricism. He calls upon the moment of inexperience: pure experience. At the time of the writing of Principles of Psychology (1890), pure experience is applicable to all states without consciousness. Examples are the sensations of newborns, comatose states, hallucinations induced by certain drugs — in short, any state in which distinctions are not yet made or cease to be made. If psychology only begins with the reﬂexive movement of introspection, then such states mark the limit of psychological investigation as such. “This stage of reﬂective condition is, more or less explicitly, our habitual adult state of mind. It cannot, however, be regarded as primitive. The consciousness of objects must come ﬁrst. We seem to lapse into this primordial condition when consciousness is reduced to a minimum by the inhalation of anaesthetics or during a faint” (emphasis mine). 2 What makes such states so difﬁcult to access analytically, is that they immerse us in a sort of “vague monism” in which we no longer distinguish subject and object, while the psychologist remains adamantly dualist. “It supposes two elements, mind knowing and thing known, and treats them as irreducible.” 3 The psychologist only intervenes as such when consciousness has already been distinguished from the object that consciousness posits before it, that is, when the object is known. The “empiricist” thus comes prior to — and grounds — the natural psychologist who is intent on describing the fact of consciousness in its duality. The empiricist tells us about the impersonal ground consciousness comes from, without being able to say anything about it. Such descriptions have their limits. By the time psychology steps in, pure experience is only accessible as always already lost. If we say that it is a matter of an experience without consciousness, psychology takes the expression in the most literal manner; it seeks the fact: at a sensory level, it is not possible to establish any distinction between consciousness and its object, either because consciousness is not yet there (the newborn), or because it is no longer there (fainting, drugs). Thus experience is pure because the one who has it is pure. Put another way, the plane is always reduced to a moment that is swiftly surpassed (and is embodied in theoretical characters, and ﬂeeting ones at that); psychology is no more capable than classical empiricism of deriving a genuine plane from these moments, which is to say, of establishing a reality co-present with all the data happening in it. In other words, psychology does not have a genetic ﬁeld at its disposal: either it traces backward toward pure experience as toward a limit yet encounters states too inconsistent to build its geneses, or it intervenes when everything is already constituted and has no other choice than to make do with already constituted geneses. It makes sense that Kant and Husserl, although guided by very different motivations, seek to constitute a transcendental ﬁeld beyond all psychology. In effect, the domain of the transcendental frees up a ﬁeld that allows for the constitution of true geneses because the ﬁeld has ﬁrst been puriﬁed of its empirical material and of the naiveties of psychological naturalism. We may go back to the pure conditions tied together by a transcendental ego in order to constitute a plane: thus Husserl may claim to have truly attained pure experience: “Its beginning is the pure — and, so to speak, still dumb — psychological experience, which now must be made to utter its own sense with no adulteration. The truly ﬁrst utterance, however, is the Cartesian utterance of the ego cogito…” 4 Oddly, however, no sooner does he reach this plane than he ﬁnds the same problem that is encountered in Descartes: the ego does not of itself make for the object of a genesis since it is, on the contrary, the condition of law. Pure means precisely that lived experiences are studied insofar they are immanent to consciousness. Transcendental philosophies free themselves well enough of empirical material yet nonetheless keep the forms inherited from psychology, even if they reorganize them to suit the requirements of their new domain. If, as we have already said, the ambition of James’s thought is to seize reality in the moment of its making, we understand why James cannot adopt either of these two approaches. He will neither pursue the material geneses of psychology, nor reconstruct the formal geneses of transcendental philosophies, for in both instances, even though every effort is made to follow the movement of what is in the making and to remain immanent to this movement, such efforts fail every time because the making is subjugated to preexisting forms that interrupt its very process. The real difﬁculty thus lies entirely in opening a third way, in establishing a pure experience that is not reducible to a pure sensory matter, nor constituted by forms of a pure subjectivity. What is needed are the ﬂeeting moments described previously, which can constitute a true plane of construction. This is what James attempts in Essays in Radical Empiricism (1904). In Principles of Psychology and subsequent texts, pure experience is only introduced within the framework of a psychological analysis or an epistemological description (which essentially means in terms of sensation). These latter texts present a signiﬁcant overturning the prior approach, proceeding in exactly the opposite direction: interpreting psychological analyses on the basis of the ﬁeld of pure experience. What becomes of subject, object, consciousness, and body from the point of view of pure experience? Dealing with them demands clearing the horizon of obstacles, to allow us to see how they are made. What must be explored are the movements that are located beneath the forms of psychology or inherited from them. We have the feeling of witnessing the birth of a new world. James’s entire enterprise lies in tracing back to what falls short of epistemological dualisms, back to where relations are given in a pure state, when they are not yet divided into any categorical binary whatsoever (subject/object; matter/spirit, etc.). It is a matter of establishing a new point of view. If at one time pure experience was manifested locally and punctually as it were, by way of certain interstices through which one caught a glimpse of chaos liberated by the matter of sensations (the dizziness of fainting or anesthesia), then, from now on, pure experience applies whatever happens, of any event, of a ﬁre burning, of a man reading in a train. It may even be applied to something entirely material, a chemical reaction. How is such an expansion possible? The general principle of pure experience is as follows: “Nothing shall be admitted as fact, it says, except what can be experienced at some deﬁnite time by some experient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a deﬁnite place must be found somewhere in the ﬁnal system of reality.” 5 Pure experience is, in a manner that remains to be deﬁned, the universal That. It is the immense world of a non-qualiﬁed, neutral material. At the same it is “an immediate ﬂow of life.” Strictly speaking, we encounter nothing more of it than a bunch of “this” and “there.” And such terms are only conventions for signifying that no qualiﬁer, even as basic as “this” and “there,” can designate this universe. None of the pure forms of transcendental philosophies are to be found. James sometimes uses the term matter but in the vague sense of stuff or materials. Unlike empirical matter, material designates a reality that can be at once physical and mental. Put another way, there is nothing purely mental or purely material, rather everything is composed of physical-mental material. James may thus say of consciousness: “There is, I mean, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made…” 6 This is a new version of vague monism. 7 Monism, however, is no longer a thinking of the All but of the interval, the in-between. It is a matter of an intermediary reality that stretches between mind and matter, precisely where they are closely merged, but on the basis of which they are distinguished as well, albeit only virtually. 8 We do not, properly speaking, yet make any distinction between them and yet we never cease to make the distinction. In other words, James elevates material to the state of true plane. He begins with the supposition that “there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed, and… we call that stuff ‘pure experience’” (emphasis mine). 9 Pure does not here mean non-empirical; on the contrary, it is empirical, nothing but empirical. It is the datum in its pure state. It is no one’s datum. It is given in itself. It is not yet given for anyone; it is a world in which neither subject nor object have yet to appear. In this sense, we may speak of radical empiricism. Experience is therefore to be expanded in a very general sense: pure experience is the set of anything that is in relation with something else without consciousness of this relation necessarily being involved. Something of this usage of “experience” may be found in the French expression faire une experience or “to do an experience,” which means “to do an experiment,” for instance, an experiment on the crystallization of sodium and chloride. We are the ones who do the experiment; but the experience does not apply to us, it applies to what is put into relation: it is, in fact, the sodium and chloride that crystallize; as such, it is indeed they who do the experience of crystallization. Insofar as it is pure, experience may equally well apply to “subjects” as to “objects” (which is but a manner of speaking since neither subject nor object exists at this level).', "Hi everyone, HH (Halbe K), I'm replying to one of your comments: 7. Ok, more of a lot for me!. 'universal That', 'non-qualified, neutral material', 'Strictly speaking, we encounter nothing more of it than a bunch of of ‘this’ and ‘there’.' Well, I can’t say I follow all this, I relate the index of 'this' and 'there' to the comment on 'vague monism': 'This is a new version of vague monism. (7) Monism, however, is no longer a thought of the All but of the interval, the in-between.' This is that pure experience is an emphasis of the many relations of anything that is 'giving' not yet to anyone in particular. And the emphasis of 'this' and 'there' (which is not even enough to qualify this 'sort of emphasis') is an 'interval' of the 'vague monism'. I understand this 'interval' like a 'portion-ing', versus the 'totality' -of the monism. It is what is given of ALL the stuff of experience. And here something more about the 'interval' that refers to a comment of Mr. Andre Fogliano (Andre A). This 'vague monism' with its 'intervals', is an 'intermediary' between what is commonly called 'mind and matter'. And in footnote 8 it is said that the 'intermediary' is what accompanies and distinguishes (as immanently generates, I think) the 'distinction' between a reality outside actual consciousness and consciousness. Moreover, the footnote says that the intermediary is not something underlying 'matter' or 'consciousness': 'something intimately mingled with conscious life, interwoven with it, and not underlying it, as substantialism would have it.' So, this sentence on the 'intermediary' makes me think about the intermediaries that are needed to follow the temporality of our current political climate. The intermediary suggests that the movements are happening already everywhere (and elsewhere and then) and that they escape a 'root' or 'starting point'. So I guess we have to be launched forward (and backward- since the time of pure experience is not linear) with the intervals/intermediaries to find the techniques to capacitate the production of modes of living that move away from the 'laws' of transcendence and substantially. Those 'laws' that assume to know what the 'identity of experience' and thus a 'body', is. Moving away and forward (and backward) in such a way that the identity of experience can't be assumed (or know) and thus can't be prevented (or preempted) to move through intermediaries that capacitate further living.

I went there with choreographer Diego Gil and visual artist Siglinde Langholz. The Skyspace called 'Dividing the Light gathers visitors on benches beneath a canopy that frames a window to the sky. At dusk and dawn a lighting program bathes the canopy in changing colors, from goldenrod to turquoise, altering the viewer’s perception of the sky. One moment it’s a dreamy lavender, another it’s an ominous tablet of black. A shallow pool centered beneath the opening to the sky mirrors the daytime sky and reflects a dark echo of the night sky'(https://www.pomona.edu/museum/collections/james-turrell-skyspace 2017).In this installation, we were attracted to a corner in one of the benches. We piled our bodies in that corner, with our heads on top of some one else’s stomachs. From there, we were watching up, until our eyes started getting tired. We started practicing soft focus. The soft focus would start creating —in-relation with the installation’s durational sunset a blurring of the edges of the square that was the sky and the square that was the architecture framing the sky until suddenly for minuscule amounts of time all the edges would disappear, including the sense of our own bodies’ edges. This was a becoming sky, as we recall it. this moment of the blurring of the edges was so so crucial to the experience. in that moment there was this bathed experience of being in the taste of colorality. but there were these snippets of seconds where there was a indistinct parsing of what was going on. like a blending with. becoming and at the same time unbecoming, being unmade but then at the same time you would grasp this sensation only a bit after, once you were with clear focus again and retrospectively you would come to friends with the 'leaving' the presupposed separated oneness with which we carry our bodies so often. those spare seconds of unbecoming or feeling being unmade make me think of this 'state in which disticntions are not yet or cease to be made' have you ever experienced something like that? i think an mm usually experiences this when she 'stares' blankly to a wall. or nothing in particular. and also and mostly in the transitional moment of waking up. when not much is yet felt in terms of CONTRASTS. i also wonder if this installation can be experienced at all by DeafBlind communities?! is colour something that can be experienced in terms of vibrational INTENSITIES, flavours?'immerse us in a sort of 'vague monism' this makes me laugh. because an mm finds herself constantly in these states of 'vague monism'! haha.

I keep thinking of that poem and the question of the PRIMITIVE and somehow i connect it with this PRIMAL STUFF that James with Lapoujade gives us. and i wonder if this primal stuff. this what's moving beneath are not life forces. what has not yet been organized, what is in the sprinkle, or as 'ALWAYS ON THE VERGE'. so perhaps that becoming 'primitive' the poem call forth, has something to do with the becoming LAUNCHED forth-back-ward into a production of modes of living. which would be a BECOMING EXPERIMENTAL. and an mm wants to lace this even further with a feeling or weighting of the 'being present' moved by James toward 'becoming CO-PRESENT'. which would account for a politics of becoming ONTOGENETIC?! meaning perhaps, becoming-with, moving-with what's moving, what makes a difference, with contrast, moving THERE-THIS?! instead of moving with what otherwise FEELS 'imposed somehow over what moves beneath?', like learning to feel the difference and experimenting (exprimire-squeeze?) with that, to feel: does it move or does it tightens? to learn to move with what moves on the cracks of what's created at the limit of the 'constrictures' of/ (as Erin calls them) and the life's movings, that constant dance? in the way of the tiny absolutes. WHAT'S FELT! to follow those intervals?! i also like how the PLANE feels so close to the piece of rubber shared last week by James. 'WHAT IS NEEDED ARE THE FLEETING MOMENTS ... which can CONSTITUTE A ... PLANE OF CONSTRUCTION' a plane of experimentation, like an scrolling of the eternal scroll of 'doing something without knowing what it is that is being done !' walk for mm, dessert, lunch or nap. on the verge!", "So much here! First a set of definitions and then a reply to all the scintillating comments!!! What is empiricism? -a plane that allows for observing how exceeding our limits, beliefs, judgments - does not allow for anything outside. - begins with a plane where nothing is preestablished, where no form of knowledge, no certainty — even virtual — has yet appeared, such that everything has the right to be constructed. What is pure experience? - is applicable to all states without consciousness (any state in which distinctions are not yet made or cease to be made.) - Pure means precisely that lived experiences are studied insofar they are immanent to consciousness. - beneath the forms of psychology or inherited from them -' Nothing shall beadmitted as fact, it says, except what can be experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a definite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality. - the immense world of a non-qualified, neutral material. At the same it is 'an immediate flow of life.' - the interval, the in-between - a stuff of which everything is composed - Pure does not here mean non-empirical; on the contrary, it is empirical, nothing but empirical. It is the datum in its pure state. - the set of anything that is in relation with something else without consciousness of this relation necessarily being involved.", "What is the difference between the impersonal and a blank slate (hh) 'I guess inexperience, so far, are the moments where one does not have the experience yet, does not know yet, or is not yet set in the knower known division even.' On purity: 'Experience always emerges in conditions. But then it is never ‘pure’ ?' >> pure doesn’t mean without anything else. It means with everything else! So as experience is reduced, it is less pure. Love this hh: 'Not matter + form, but rather material that is traversed by all sorts of forces which makes it empirical and more-than empirical, or radical, since it involves everything that makes a difference.' Andre, yes! 'what must be explored are the movements moving beneath' 'I wonder, though, what is the 'definite place [that[ must be found somewhere in the final system of reality?' – this is the reminder that pure experience is radically empirical (that despite its vagueness it must never be generalized – its conditioning of experience is always precise) A: 'how can we come to a procedure to trace back to the movements beaneath the subjects and objects that populates the plane where we are enmeshed??' I think this returns us to the multiplicity of the event of which we are always not one. So the plane includes our moreness. DD I love this! 'I understand this 'interval' like a 'portion-ing', versus the 'totality' -of the monism. It is what is given of ALL the stuff of experience.' DD/A on the sentence: 'and that they escape a 'root' or 'starting point'' as regards the political – I think this can really be felt with the global outrage at the moment. Racism has been with us, in us for so long. The protests are not about 1 dead person. The protests can’t be individualized. But their specificity (that they are happening now) does matter.", "Hi! Thank HH, mm and Erin for the 'inflexions'. I keep thinking with AA/AF about 'this' particular political moment through the 'interval' as an 'intermediary'. And I need some thought/help. For example, I see Trump's gesture to mobilize the army against the protest as a 'total' gesture. There is not 'world in the making' not a register of the 'intermediary events' that escalated to this massive and spread protest (this, there, here and elsewhere) but a full reaction. And I'm horrified to think that this gesture may look like a 'decisive', 'known' and 'clear and distinct' for Trump's supporters, and thus that it will raise his popularity. So, I'm thinking what would I do if I were an 'activist': how would I activate through that total gesture without another one to one total reaction? What would be the interval techniques that slide away from that total gesture? What would it mean in the context of a protest to 'interval' through the military presence/force? Would it mean to intensify the care for the intermediary relations, for the pockets of resistance spread everywhere (and anywhere and this and there)? DD", "Wow. Yes. The impossible questions. It always seems to me that in these times of escalated unrest (escalated in the sense that it is more vivid for those who aren’t always already living it) the grand has a real danger of trampling the minor gestures, and yet it is at the level of the minor that there is most elbow-room for change. I suppose we always fall prey (myself included) to the belief that it’s the big change that makes a difference. But the big change is often an empty gesture that has little effect on the qualities of everyday life. So much of what Brian writes about ontopower (power in the bare activity of experience) is so decisive, isn’t it? What the right has always known how to do is multiply and confuse at that level, to really work in the affective tonalities of the moment. So I am not sure it’s quite true to say that Trump works at the level of the 'decisive' though I totally understand that it feels that way. I think what Trump does is keep thinks off kilter so that content can move in more than one way in the abyss he creates (by opening up the field with the confusion he sows, more than one way of disrupting is made possible). So many people have written about the danger of the left remaining 'discursive.' We all know that all those articles stating the 'facts' make little difference. The affective tonality is shifted in the Trumpian lie in ways that have already recalibrated the field. The horror of radical empiricism taken seriously is that it shows us as much about how the right works as anything else… My tendency (always) is to say we need practices. We can see in this time that the practice of gathering makes a difference. We know that it foregrounds an energy that shifts the conversation. And it feels so vital to move with others in these moments. But as so many social justice activists have said, the ongoing work is where things can really change. It seems to me, DD, that your question/comment touches the durational quality of this ongoingness. As some of you know, I have written (in a moment of burnout in 2014) about the difference between the front lines and the sidelines. I have a sense that it would be good to be more involved in understanding sidelines. The sidelines have a different curve, a different temporality, a different ongoingness. Less frontal by nature, they activate momentums that may teach us something complex about how we (as an 'I') are not as central as we may have thought. I wonder here about something like PT that can’t be spoken alone. Is this a thinking of sidelines at work? Would love to hear from others. So much pain these days, and confusion about how to do this work. xxErin", "Thank you Erin and yes, decision is of the event. I was reading decision as that ‘macro’ effect the Trumps wants to create toward his supporters. And yes, I’m thinking the ‘interval’ as onto powerful, as part of an ongoing durational quality. I’m also curious to hear about other sidelines practices, such as PT can be. With care, DD", "Hey Erin! Your thoughts on these times, and how the right works—via fake news, reification, literally creating things to suit them—provides such comfort! Our reading group here is definitely an activity that will help us through. Curious, though. I have never related to the description of the left and the right and all that being on a line or a spectrum. Like you have the far right, or you have left of center. Like this line, it’s a flat single line, and you’re supposed to be somewhere on that line? Maybe in politics, party politics, maybe very often they force this line to be something. I’ve always sensed a spiral instead of a line. Like a water slide! Different people may enter it at different points and come out on different outslides onto the water. I suspect this would reflect more what individuals really think or feel, all the different things they support or don’t support, at different levels, as it relates to different spheres. One may be privately in favor but on the job against bexause of X but were Y to develop… But seems forces want to flatten all of that nuance, right? Is sidelining, then, or minor gestures, about bringing nuance back into it, building nuance? Because it’s surely not as simple that, hey, the left needs to take chare and get rid of the right! Because IF the left does take power but it’s STILL in a flat-line realm, that’s not going to be much better, would it? If it’s still grand, and still despotic, and does not allow for messy messes? Yes, on some levels, PT is resistant to the grand, or does not allow for one person addressing a large audience—one person taking and holding the stage. PT on a linguistical level breaks that up, for sure. Not to say that you can’t still be a leader or accumulate certain kinds of power. I don’t know what it may be like, but my point is PT folks are still human, and I’m sure not all of us are saints! But at least, on some structural levels, it’s all small clusters, allowing for many nuanced and shifting conversations, you can’t say one thing and the same thing to everyone because each person or cluster you address is different. Yet you can have a collective understanding—not that everyone has the same thing in mind, but draws from the same shared thing in each person’s own way of drawing from it or contributing to it. We all have access to that. So maybe we have differentnesses and we have some shared things, but where they’re at, at what levels, those are very different than what you would have for mass media, mass communications, one person having the ability to address millions, for good or for ill. If Trump’s instinct is to create room and possibilities—his pulling Antifa out of nowhere is a perfect example, it can mean anything, including anyone who goes against him even if it becomes recognized he’s a fascist, wow, how insidiously cunning that is!—but sidelining and the minor gesture are about elbow room for change… what is the fundamental difference? Is it scale? Or angle? What is the fundamental difference between creating confusion and embracing complexity? Because we do want to appreciate compoexity, we want a caring that is sensitive and listens and flexible. That is very different from what Trump is doing, for sure, and one result Trump is hoping for is that people will become tired and want a simpler thing and will accept Trump as the simple thing, accept a dictator so we don’t have to think. Would love more thoughts to help us read these times better! Hugs, John"]
