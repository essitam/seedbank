const anarchiveDef = ['The anarchive is best defined for the purposes of the Immediations project as a repertory of traces of collaborative research-creation events. The traces are not inert, but are carriers of potential. They are reactivatable, and their reactivation helps trigger a new event which continues the creative process from which they came, but in a new iteration.', 'Thus the anarchive is not documentation of a past activity. Rather, it is a feed-forward mechanism for lines of creative process, under continuing variation.', 'The anarchive needs documentation – the archive – from which to depart and through which to pass. It is an excess energy of the archive: a kind of supplement or surplus-value of the archive', 'Its supplemental, excessive nature means that it is never contained in any particular archive or documentation element contained in an archive. It is never contained in an object. The anarchive is made of the formative movements going into and coming out of the archive, for which the objects contained in the archive serve as springboards. The anarchive as such is made of formative tendencies; compositional forces seeking a new taking-form; lures for further process. Archives are their waystations.', 'Since it exceeds the archive and is uncontainable in any single object or collection of objects, the anarchive is by nature a cross-platform phenomenon. It is activated in the relays: between media, between verbal and material expressions, between digital and off-line archivings, and most of all between all of the various archival forms it may take and the live, collaborative interactions that reactivate the anarchival traces, and in turn create new ones.', 'The anarchive pertains to the event. It is a kind of event derivative, or surplus-value of the event. This makes it an essential element of the Immediations project, whose stated aim has been to develop an approach to research-creation as a practice of interdisciplinary event design, or to quote the original application, as the practice of creating innovative “platforms for organizing and orienting live, collaborative encounters.”', 'Approached anarchivally, the product of research-creation is process. The anarchive is a technique for making research-creation a process-making engine. Many products are produced, but they are not the product. They are the visible indexing of the process’s repeated taking-effect: they embody its traces (thus bringing us full circle to point 1).']

const anarchivingPropositions = ['_anarchival composting_: what emerges in the middle, in between whatever processes take shape and through whatever appetites exist or emerge, becomes the food for an an ongoing composing-with: compositing, always tending to that which is leftover in the event which finds itself in the edges of experience. It is a play and rigorous experimentation with a continuous changing varierty of materials wherein through propositions new techniques are invented and contrasting qualities are grasped. Composting foregrounds the process in all its openness, in what it can facilitate as well as construct, to be practice in the midst. Anarchival composting is then purely transversal, where the other thriving processes, such as re-zone-ate_ors, the wilds, 3 ecologies process seedbank, and speculative feltversing are involved in the sparks and sustaining of a going-with the surplus value of life.', '_re-zone-ate_ors_: what is sustainability in the over-politicized field, where all intensities are amplified and accelerated engendering possible dangerous symptoms and risks that make life unlivable? What micro-aggressions keep surfacing when the fields are not tended to, not cared for but rather are filled and saturated with communication and too much of the present. Re-zone-ate_ors approaches such fields to think-feel other ways of going about, to find techniques that create the vital breath in the choking spaces, and to enable modes of saying no against the operative logic while not relapsing to sedimentary and judgemental ways of whatever can take up the lived (e.g. identity politics, phenomenology).', '_the wilds_: to rewild the fields, planes, and territories involves a radical pedagogy of the earth (Rose-Antoinette) where thinking is always with and through those planes or what inhabits it. The wilds has been foregrounding a rewilding of reading, or how to read otherwise. The wilds proposes to read-with in radical empirical yet speculative fabulatory manners, think-feel with speciation (Manning), animality (Massumi), and a broad geo-philosophy (Deleuze and Guattari). Anna Tsing’s Mushrooms at the End of the World (2015) with patches of mushroom.; Sy Montgomery’s The Soul of an Octopus (2015) with tentacular body masks with a cephalopodness to its textures; Jeffrey Cohen’s Stone: an Ecology of the Inhuman (2015) reading through our backs while rubbings backs on rocks.', '_speculative feltversing_: when qualities (the pinkest pink, to greg, organging) allow the unfolding of a multitude of worlds: there is a universe knocking on the window (Guattari), it is felt on the edge of experience (Manning) now can we fabulate with that emergent universe, that feltverse, to construct new realities, new futures? Speculative feltversing aligns itself with SF — Science-Fiction, Speculative-Fiction, String-Figures, San-Francisco? (Haraway) — by attuning itself to a radical pragmatism while tending to the more-than in its speculation; it takes care of the left-overs of any event, that which is not at the center of the event and allows potential other worlds to emerge and take consistency.']
