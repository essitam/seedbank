          This experiment is wonderizng if this still amorphous, still unknown ‘thing’
          could become a mini-issue. The quality of this mini-issue perhaps tends toward fragments
          rather than complete text due to the limitations of language to express outside of language or outside of
          models of thought imbedded within a language that already creates the micro aggressions that these feelings
          are trying to resist. In a way it is a cry(on) of expression.

        <p>it is not that the term [micro-aggressions] per se is problematic, if it came across like that then that’s
          not right. What I was trying to say is that I feel, after having read quite a lot of articles revolving around
          the subject, that the field is incredibly polarised because it is saturated with identity thinking. So it is
          not too say we can’t engage with it, it was more to caution warning with a term that laden, to move with it
          extra carefully. At the same time I felt some of the examples we mentioned do not move into that field, or
          rather they escape that field precisely because they had a different point of entree or moved in a different
          way. I mean those examples that did not directly concern racial issues and that were more concerned with
          processual thinking and what it would mean to say no in regards to that</p>

        <p>"In a violently poetic text, Lawrence describes what produces poetry: people are constantly putting up an
          umbrella that shelters them and on the underside of which they draw a firmament and write their conventions
          and opinions. But poets, artists, make a slit in the umbrella, they tear open the firmament itself, to let in
          a bit of free and windy chaos and to frame in a sudden light a vision that appears through the
          rent-Wordsworth's spring or Cezanne's apple, the silhouettes of Macbeth or Ahab. Then come the crowd of
          imitators who repair the umbrella with something vaguely resembling the vision, and the crowd of commentators
          who patch over the rent with opinions: communication. Other artists are always needed to make other slits, to
          carry out necessary and perhaps ever-greater destructions, thereby restoring to their predecessors the
          incommunicable novelty that we could no longer see."

          how it feels in the looking up (into the light) and the drips that escape down -- the porosity -- and thinking
          with vacuoles, and also how with leaves, once the water levels have reach a full capacity, they tighten and
          close, so that the water can then drift off --- and then (carrying over from another conversation) the sound
          of water when you open the umbrella and it already has some water on it, so the droplets suddenly shower-off
          (a bit) and that differentiating sound, and how you can play with that, amongst the surplus of the
          already-going-on-rain. >>> and all towards questions around how to carry the multiple capacities for
          opening(s)/closing(s), or leaning (out) or intrinsic temporalities</p>
